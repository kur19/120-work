# HOMEWORK SUMMARY

I started the homework this week as I usually do: following along with the videos and visiting the references.  this has been the most invigorating work we have done so far.  I felt the project was accessible to me and I am understanding most parts of the descriptions (although I still struggle with radian and degree).

## CHOICES

I made very basic choices as I followed along with Dr. Musick's example.  I was shooting for a self-portrait, but it turned into a monster, strangely.  I changed the ratio's of the body, legs, arms, and head features, as well as canvas color and character colors.  This was both eye-opening and in real time whcih again is exciting in the potential that is offered for artists.

### STEPS

I would say that the steps involve trial and error on my part.  I think this is an ongoing theme for me in every week.

#### PROBLEMS

I had fewer problems.  Yes, sometimes the code worked and at other points, it failed, but the fixes were fairly easy and satisfying.  My main interest in looking forward is to the alpha function.  I hope we cover this in more detail, or I will stop by Dr. Musick's office.
