# HW-4 Response:

The work for this week was both challenging and exciting as it represented my first attempt at creating an image via coding in javascript.  The challenges that I faced were internalizing the math for radiums and degrees.  Fundamentally, I understand the concept, and hope to conceptualize it further.

I followed Dr. Musick's video tutorial closely and my resulting sketch varies only slightly.  I'm very interested in the alpha feature in coding.  I have the same basic structure and my image falls somewhere between personal portrait and monster.  I altered the rectangle size, as well as the triangles for the legs and the stroke weight for the arms.

I'm Looking forward to further projects and animation in the upcoming weeks.



## Final sketch

Here is my sketch:
